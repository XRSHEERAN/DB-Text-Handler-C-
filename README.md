# C\# Demos

## DB Management
*This demo deals with Access Data Base. Generates a Windows Form and could complete all database management tasks. **This Code is Not Complete** since this is only my own sketch for previous intern project whose full version is confidential. Notice:**This Skech has Nothing to do with the final version of my intern project.** Just a glance of my experience with .net programming*

## PDF Extract
*This demo intake a text file from pdf and extracts the required information. The source text is in Japanese, so I was confused about the encoding in the first place when extracting text from pdf. **This code is also incomplete** due to the same reason as above and it's just my **own sketch**. The pdf information details are not disclosed due to confidential policy and this demo is just about playing around with regex and string methods. Again, **This Skech has Nothing to do with the final version of my intern project.***
